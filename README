== Developer Instructions. ==


Since the project is gaining some momentum and thus the code base grows the following are some instructions that developers should follow.
(In the early stages of this change many of the points mentioned here won't be present in the codebase, if that's true then add them).
So, every pull request (for non-commiters) or commits to be merged to the next,next-dev branches should follow the following:

* Unit Tests:
We are trying to introduce unit tests which is usually a very good idea. So:

** New features should come with php-unit unit tests testing that the feature works as expected
** All the code should pass the existing unit tests before merging
** If you have to modify a test make sure that nothing else breaks

* Coding - Style:

A couple of years ago we decided to adopt the Drupal coding style, so with some lag it's a very good idea to do that.
** Every commit shouldn't generate any errors with  PHP_CodeSniffer (to fix most errors you can use PHP Coding Standards Fixer )

* Commits
Clean commits make it easy to review code  and make sure that it only does one thing. So:

** One commit should fix one problem or introduce one feature only, please don't commit fixes all around the place.
** Commits should be atomic, each commit should work by itself
** Only what you modified goes in the commit ( for example you shouldn't commit vim/project files or anything unrelated)
** The commit message should explain what you did
** Every commit should merge with next-dev without conflicts (rebase often)
